# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset

In this notebook, we delve into the domain of sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset. The primary goal is to train a model capable of classifying movie reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed.

## Key Steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the IMDB dataset containing movie reviews and their corresponding sentiments.
2. **Text Vectorization**: Converting the raw text data into numerical vectors for input into the neural network.
3. **Model Architecture**: Designing a neural network model suitable for sentiment analysis.
4. **Model Compilation**: Defining the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics for training.
5. **Model Training**: Utilizing the training set to optimize the model parameters.
6. **Training Visualization**: Displaying graphs of loss and accuracy to assess the model's performance.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on the test set.
8. **Inference**: Making predictions on new or unseen reviews.

## Core Concepts Explored:

- **Embedding Layer**: Transforming input text into dense vectors of fixed size.
- **Sequential Model**: Constructing a neural network with a linear stack of layers.
- **Dense Layers**: Employing densely connected layers for information propagation.
- **Activation Function**: Incorporating activation functions for introducing non-linearity.
- **Binary Classification**: Configuring the model for binary sentiment classification.

## Evaluation Metrics:

- **Loss**: Measurement of error during model training.
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances.

This notebook serves as an exploration of sentiment analysis using neural networks, providing insights into text vectorization, model design, training, and evaluation on the IMDB dataset.
